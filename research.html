        		<h2>Prediction</h2>
				<p> It has been proposed that readers and listeners generate predictions about messages is likely to be conveyed and, based on such internal models, translate such high-level expectations into progressively lower-level expectations about the upcoming stimuli, and eventually generate form-based expectations about what features the upcoming word will contain. In alphabetic languages, however, since phonological and orthographical features are correlated, it is oftentimes unclear what exact representations is predicted. I am currently developing a study using materials from Chinese, an orthographically-opaque language, to starte whether and when people generate expectations about the visual features in the langauge stimuli. </p>

        		<h2>Adaptation</h2>
				<p> Listeners and readers have been shown to rapidly incorporate
knowledge about the current communicative context to modify their predictions in the same context, i.e. adaptation effect. Such ability renders the processing system great flexibility when encountering unfamiliar situations or fulfilling specific task demands. However, in a hierarchical predictive processing system, how prediction errors are interpreted at one level will be subject to how prediction errors are distributed at other levels. I am working on a few different projects to address how adaptation will happen in the face of different distribution of prediction errors across the hierarchy. </p>

        		<h2>Prosody</h2>
				<p> Prosody, i.e. the pauses and intonation changes in speech, includes rich information about lexical identity (i.e. in tonal langauges),syntactic phrasing, as well as the intention of the speaker. I am interested in when is prosody treated and how is it processed in the language system.
